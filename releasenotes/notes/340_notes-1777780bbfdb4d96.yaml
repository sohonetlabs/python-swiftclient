features:

  - The ``swift`` CLI now supports streaming from stdin. If "-" is given
    as the source, the object content is read from stdin. The
    ``--object-name`` must be given when content is loaded from stdin.
  - Tolerate RFC-compliant ETags returned from the server.
  - Skip checksum validation on partial downloads.
  - Buffer reads from disk, resulting in much faster upload throughput.
  - >
    Added support for ISO 8601 timestamps for tempurl, matching the
    feature in Swift 2.13.0.
  - Added an option to ignore mtime metadata entry (``--ignore-mtime``).
  - >
    When using SwiftService to delete many objects, the bulk delete page
    size will now be respected. Previously, exceeding this limit would
    prevent any objects from being deleted.
  - Expose `--prefix` as an option for st_delete.
  - Imported docs content from openstack-manuals project.
  - Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.
