features:

    Allow for object uploads > 5GB from stdin.

    When uploading from standard input, swiftclient will turn the upload
    into an SLO in the case of large objects. By default, input larger
    than 10MB will be uploaded as an SLO with 10MB segment sizes. Users
    can also supply the ``--segment-size`` option to alter that
    threshold and the SLO segment size. One segment is buffered in
    memory (which is why 10MB default was chosen).

  - |
    The ``--meta`` option can now be set on the upload command.

  - |
    Updated PyPy test dependency references to be more accurate
    on different distros.
